## Quantum Image Encryption Algorithm 

The goal of this project is to generate an image encryption algorithm that
efficiently and effectively encodes digital image information in a secure way. 

The current novel quantum-digital-image representation is known as the "Novel
Enhanced Quantum Representation"
([NEQR](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-013-0567-z_)) of digital images which uses the basis state of a qubit sequence to store the gray-scale value of each pixel in the image. There are a few other methods as well, but they are all incredibly similar and only have distinctions in how they prepare the qubits.

This project aims to generate a quantum algorithm that, for now, requires 

$$\left( \frac{n^2}{2^m}  + 1 \right) \times (m-1)$$ 

qubits to fully encrypt a color image, where $m$ is some integer such that $2^m$ is less than half the # $n\times n$ of pixels. In the future I will attempt
to reduce the qubit requirement based on the receiver's demand for
image-quality.

This qubit requirement is quite large, however the preparation time requirement
to generate the quantum wave function that describes the image is less. 

Perhaps when quantum computers become advanced enough such that the qubit
requirement is not an issue will this project has some benefit. For now, it is
just a new way to imagine encoding information using hyperspheres and multi-dimensional wave functions.

I do have interesting ideas to incorporate NEQR with the hypersphere idea to
potentially reduce the qubit requirement even further than NEQR but that will
be in the future.

The Algorithm roughly performs the following sequence of steps: 

- Extract the pixel information from an image and convert $2^n$ pixels (top
  left to bottom right)
  reversibly into an $n$-dimensional statevector. 
- Generate a $2^n$ dimensional hypersphere, where each $2^n$ dimensional unit
  vector points to a set of $2^n$ pixel's $(R,G,B)$ information
- Group sequences of $n$-dimensional statevectors; run them all through
  randomized gates of large depth and afterwards generate mixed state density
  matrix as a linear combination of the resulting statevectors post-circuit
  within each original sequence 
  - I use IBM's statevector simulator backend as there exists no real backend
    to handle this project's qubit requirement
  - I generate the coefficients in the linear combination by calculating the 
    fidelity (matrix "distance" in the $2^n$ dimensional hilbert space) with an
    randomly generated density matrix
- Spectral decomposition is then performed on the resulting mixed density
  matrices to extract possible pure state eigenvectors along with their
  corresponding probability eigenvalues 
- The Von Neumann Entropy of each mixed density matrix is calculated based on
  the probability eigenvalues of each matrix
- The mixed density matrix eigenvectors order is altered based on decreasing entropy
- I convert all the eigenvectors back into $2^n$ dimensional unit-vectors and
  extract their corresponding RGB information 
- Generate the encrypted image using the RGB information


This whole process is reversible. Here's some examples: 


#### Original Image

#### Encrypted Image w/ 119 qubits

#### Decrypted Image

Encrypting this 64x64 (4096px) image took 149.5 seconds -- quite slow. The
corresponding qubit requirement is 119.

In addition, if you re-run the encryption algorithm, the outputted image
changes, *while also still* storing the information of the original image,
along with a private key and a 2^n dimensional hypersphere. Again, I will
provide specifics later.

If I increase the allowed qubit requirement to 771 qubits, the image gets
encrypted in just 9.2 seconds:

Initial Image:

#### Encrypted Image
